    <h1>Why you should make an FAQ page ?</h1>
    <div class="faq-container">

            <h3 class="faq-title">
                Saves time
            </h3>

            <p class="faq-text">
                This reason might be the most obvious, but it’s a clear benefit of an FAQ page. Not only does the FAQ page save customers time, it saves employees time as well. Having an FAQ page ensures customers don’t have to sit on the phone for hours waiting for simple answers and employees don’t have to individually answer all questions.

                Earns trust
            </h3>

            <p class="faq-text">
                Information is available at the click of a button, but as we all know, information is not always true. Because of this, customers are more skeptical than ever before. They hunt for products by sifting through reviews, looking at the product on multiple websites, and price checking across the internet.

                Provides new insights
            </h3>

            <p class="faq-text">
                It’s difficult to get into the head of a shopper. Some buy on impulse and others buy after thorough research. By tracking the clicks on your FAQ page you can gather insights about your product or service that you didn’t know before. You can then inform your product team of these insights. From there, the product team can make changes to improve the product or experience.

            <p class="faq-text">
                If you want your FAQ to be extremely thorough, which it should be, you can link to resources within your FAQ for your customers to find out more information. Whether you link to a blog that goes into more detail or a product page, this content helps the shoppers get the full story before making a purchase.

            <p class="faq-text">
                When looking through negative reviews, there’s almost always one thing in common— the problem could’ve been avoided.
